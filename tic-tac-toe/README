# Tic-Tac-Toe Reinforcement Learning

This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Reinforcement Learning techniques. The objective is to train an agent to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally through exploration and exploitation of the game environment.

## Introduction

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet classic game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. In this project, we use Reinforcement Learning to train an agent to play Tic-Tac-Toe and learn from its experiences.

## How It Works

The agent uses the following techniques:

- **Q-Learning**: A model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the value of actions in given states.
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: The agent balances exploring new moves with exploiting known strategies to maximize its reward.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reinforcement-learning.git
cd reinforcement-learning/tic-tac-toe
pip install -r requirements.txt
